This is the SympyTeX package. It allows you to embed code, results of
computations, and (sometimes!) plots from the Matplotlib software suite
(http://www.sympy.org) into LaTeX documents.
====================================================================

To use SympyTeX, you need the files sympytex.sty and sympytex.py. If those
haven't been extracted from the .dtx file, you'll need to do:

  0. Run `latex sympytexpackage.ins'

If a PDF file of the documentation wasn't included with this
distribution of SympyTeX, you will need to build the documentation
yourself. To do that:

  1. Run `latex sympytexpackage.dtx'
  2. Run `python sympytexpackage.sympy'
  3. Run the indexing commands that the .ins file told you about.
  4. Run `latex sympytexpackage.dtx' again.

You can skip step 3 if you don't care about the index. You will need the
pgf and tikz packages installed to typeset the figures.

The file example.tex has, as you likely guessed, a bunch of examples
showing you how this package works.

This works builds on a lot of work by others; in particular the work of
Dan Drake <ddrake@member.ams.org> who created the sagetex package from which
this is shamelessly copied see the "Credits" section
of the documentation for credits. The source code may be modified and

Please let me know if you find any bugs or have any ideas for
improvement!
